# TenFold
1.) X amount of people join/download the app. (Android) 2.) "X" will be divided into groups of ten. 3.) Each person of a group will "donate" slash give $1 a day for 10 days. 4.) At the end of the 10 day period, there will be something to define a "winner" (drawing, puzzle, trivia question, SOMETHING. 5.) The winner will get 100 dollars (provided each user indeed "donated" their $1 a day for the 10 day period. (potentially turning $10 into $100 dollars. 6.) If a winner did failed to pay their dollar for how ever many days in the ten day period, there will be a 10% deduction from the "Pot" for each day the winner failed to contribute their $1. (that amount will remain in the pot for the next ten day period winner. 7.) A single person cannot win more than twice a month. (2 out of 3 ten day periods) |TIM BELEW|
